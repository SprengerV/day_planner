# day_planner

This project sets out to create simple yet effective day planner. Using explicitly defined blocks corresponding to the hours of the works day, the user will be able to enter tasks and events for the day in order to effectively manage their time. The events are color coded to indicate how urgent they are, relative to the current time of day. The information entered is saved to local storage so as to persist when revisiting the page.
